# PostureGuard

## Software Discipline

PostureGuard falls under the discipline of **Health and Wellness Technology** within the broader scope of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **Computer Vision Applications**. This project utilizes real-time posture analysis to improve user ergonomics and productivity, addressing a key challenge in maintaining health while working at a computer.

## Problem Statement

Prolonged periods of poor posture while working at a computer can lead to significant health issues, including spinal discomfort, musculoskeletal pain, and reduced focus. While existing solutions like small alerts and notifications attempt to address this, they often fail to capture attention effectively, allowing users to continue poor habits. There is a critical need for a solution that not only detects poor posture but also actively interrupts the userâ€™s workflow to enforce immediate correction, promoting long-term health and productivity.

## Motivation

As someone who spends extended hours coding, I often find myself deeply engrossed in my work, ignoring subtle reminders to correct my posture. This has led to discomfort and an awareness of the long-term risks of poor ergonomics. I realized that small, dismissible alerts are insufficient for someone like me who prioritizes work progress over fleeting notifications. 

The goal of PostureGuard is to provide a strict, unavoidable intervention that forces me to pause, assess, and fix my posture before I can continue working. By ensuring that I maintain a healthy posture throughout the day, I aim to protect my spine, enhance focus, and sustain productivity over the long term.

## Core Idea

PostureGuard leverages real-time posture monitoring to enforce good ergonomic habits by actively interrupting work when poor posture is detected. The interruption only resolves once the user corrects their posture, ensuring an effective and impactful reminder to maintain health and wellness while working.
