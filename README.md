# 🧍 PostureGuard

PostureGuard is a desktop application that enforces good ergonomic habits by locking the user's screen when poor posture is detected. It only unlocks when the posture is corrected or a manual override key is pressed.

## 🧠 Software Discipline

PostureGuard falls under the discipline of **Health and Wellness Technology**, within the broader field of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **Computer Vision Applications**.

This project utilizes real-time posture analysis to improve user ergonomics and productivity, addressing a key challenge in maintaining health while working at a computer.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Prolonged periods of poor posture while working can lead to:

- Spinal discomfort and pain  
- Musculoskeletal strain  
- Decreased focus and productivity  

Traditional solutions like alerts or subtle notifications often fail to interrupt unhealthy habits. There is a need for a tool that actively enforces posture correction before allowing the user to continue working.

## 💡 Motivation

As someone who spends extended hours coding, I often find myself ignoring subtle posture cues. This led to recurring discomfort and awareness of the long-term risks of poor ergonomics.

PostureGuard was created to provide a **strict, unavoidable intervention** — one that forces me to fix my posture before resuming work. The goal is to protect spinal health, increase focus, and build better ergonomic discipline over time.

## 🌟 Core Idea

PostureGuard works by:

- Monitoring your posture in real time  
- Triggering a fullscreen white screen when poor posture is detected  
- Blocking interaction until posture is corrected or a manual override (e.g., `Ctrl+Q`) is used  
- Dismissing itself automatically after a maximum configurable timeout (for safety)
